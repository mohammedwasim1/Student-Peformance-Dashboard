## **Objective**

To investigate the factors that affect a students' overall result and understand the magnitude of their influence on students' academic performance.

## **Justification**

By understanding which factors have the most significant impact on academic performance, educational institutions can design targeted interventions and strategies to improve student outcomes. For example, if study time is found to have a strong correlation with student results, schools can allocate resources to promote effective study habits and time management skills among students.

## **Steps taken**

## **Key insights**

Students who study for 6+ hours achieve 10% higher results than those who study for less than two hours.

Students who have the shortest travel time to their academic institutions (less than 15 minutes) achieve the highest overall results. The students who must travel more than one hour, obtain the lowest overall results.

Those who participate in extracurricular activities slightly higher results, than those who don't.

## **Recommendations**
